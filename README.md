# rock-paper-scissors-app
An android application where you choose rock, paper or scissors[via buttons] and compete with an auto generated response.

This was a starter project to explore Android Development.

 - Requires a set up of Android version 4 and above. 
 
 There is an auto generated response by the computer while the user needs to type on their desired input. 
 Points are distrubuted as follows:
 - You win : 2 points
 - You lose : -1 point
 - Draw : 1 point
 
 
 Feel free to optimise the game and add in more features.
